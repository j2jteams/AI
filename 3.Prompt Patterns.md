## 🧠 **Topic 3: Prompt Patterns & Frameworks**

### 🔍 Mastering Structures That Unlock Powerful AI Results

Once you understand how to *ask* the AI something, the next step is knowing **how to structure** your prompt to get the *best kind* of response. That’s where **prompt patterns** and **frameworks** come in.

---

### 🧱 What Are Prompt Patterns?

Prompt patterns are reusable **templates** or **structures** that guide how you interact with AI. Think of them as formulas for prompting that produce reliable, high-quality outputs.

These are **battle-tested styles** used by professionals for coding, reasoning, writing, teaching, and more.

---

## 🎯 Popular Prompt Patterns (With Examples)

---

### 1. **Instructional Pattern**

Use when you want the AI to *do* something clearly.

> 🔹 **Pattern**:
> “Explain \[topic] to \[audience] in \[style/format].”

> 🧠 **Example**:
> “Explain the concept of machine learning to a 10-year-old in a fun story format.”

---

### 2. **Step-by-Step (Chain-of-Thought)**

Breaks complex tasks into logical steps. Super helpful for reasoning, coding, or problem-solving.

> 🔹 **Pattern**:
> “Let’s solve this step by step.”

> 🧠 **Example**:
> “What is 19 x 27? Show me your steps before giving the final answer.”

This leads the model to *think out loud*.

---

### 3. **REACT (Reasoning + Acting)**

Used when an AI has tools or functions. It reasons first, then takes an action.

> 🔹 **Pattern**:
>
> 1. Thought: "What should I do?"
> 2. Action: "Let me search or call a function"
> 3. Observation: "What did I find?"
> 4. Repeat...

> 🧠 **Use Case**:
> Agents, LangChain, or GPTs with tools (like calculators, APIs)

> 🚨 Don’t worry about using this now—we’ll explore it fully in the *Agents* section later.

### 4. **Example-Based (Few-shot prompting)**

You show the model what kind of answers you expect by giving it a few examples.

> 🔹 **Pattern**:

```
Q: [Your question 1]
A: [Your answer 1]
Q: [Your question 2]
A: [Your answer 2]
Q: [New question]
A:
```

> 🧠 **Example**:

```
Q: What’s a fun fact about cats?
A: Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.
Q: What’s a fun fact about whales?
A:
```

---

### 5. **Compare & Contrast**

Helps you analyze two things side-by-side.

> 🔹 **Pattern**:
> “Compare \[A] and \[B] in terms of \[X, Y, Z].”

> 🧠 **Example**:
> “Compare Java and Python in terms of syntax, performance, and use cases.”

---

### 6. **Critique & Improve**

Great for improving writing, ideas, or code.

> 🔹 **Pattern**:
> “Here’s my \[content]. First critique it, then suggest improvements.”

> 🧠 **Example**:
> “Here’s my startup idea. First give me 3 pros and 3 cons, then suggest how to improve it.”

---

### 🧪 Try These Practice Prompts:

1. “Compare a lion and a dolphin in a fun table for kids.”
2. “Explain quantum physics in 3 bullet points using a step-by-step method.”
3. “Critique this email and suggest a more persuasive version.”
4. “Give 2 examples of how AI is used in healthcare. Then suggest 1 new idea.”

---

### 📘 Homework for Students

1. Use **3 different prompt patterns** from above on the same topic (e.g., AI in education).
2. Observe how the structure changes the result.
3. Create your own prompt using one of the patterns, and explain *why it worked*.
