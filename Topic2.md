## ✍️ Topic 2: **Introduction to Prompt Engineering**

### 🎯 What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the art and science of writing inputs (called *prompts*) to get useful, accurate, and creative responses from AI models like ChatGPT or Claude.

Think of it like talking to a very smart assistant—you need to ask the right way to get the best help.

### 🧱 Why is it Important?

* **Better prompts = better results**
* Helps AI act like a teacher, programmer, designer, or anything you need
* Essential skill for using AI effectively in real-world projects

---

### 🔑 Key Concepts

#### 1. **Prompt = Instruction**

It tells the AI what you want.

* ❌ Bad prompt: `Explain Java`
* ✅ Good prompt: `Explain Java to a high school student who has never coded before, using simple language and analogies.`

#### 2. **You can give the AI a Role**

This shapes the tone, depth, and structure of the output.

* Example:
  👉 `"Act as a professional resume writer. Rewrite the following job description..."`

#### 3. **You can provide Examples (Few-shot learning)**

AI performs better when you show how you'd like it to behave.

### 🧠 Prompt Formula (Simple Template)

```
Act as a [role]. Your task is to [goal].
Explain it to [audience] in [tone/style]. Use [format if needed].
```

**Example:**

```
Act as a kids’ science teacher. Your task is to explain how airplanes fly.
Explain it to a 10-year-old using simple language and analogies. Use bullet points.
```

### 💡 Tips for Beginners

* Be specific and clear
* Break big tasks into smaller ones
* Test and refine your prompt if the response isn't great
* Use bullet points, step-by-step, or numbered formats when possible

---

### ✅ Beginner Prompt Practice

Try these in ChatGPT or Claude:

1. `Act as a productivity coach. Give me 3 daily habits to stay focused.`
2. `Summarize the book “The Alchemist” in 5 sentences, like I’m a middle schooler.`
3. `Write a bedtime story about a robot learning emotions, in 100 words.`

### 📝 Student Homework

1. **Try 3 different prompt styles** using roles (e.g., teacher, coder, artist).
2. **Observe the differences in the responses.**
3. **Write your favorite prompt** that gave a great answer and share why it worked.
