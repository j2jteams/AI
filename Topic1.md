## 🧠 Topic 1: What is AI & Generative AI?

### 🔍 What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. It's used in:

* Spam filters
* Voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
* Recommendation engines (Netflix, YouTube)

### 🤖 Types of AI:

* **Narrow AI**: Focused on one task (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Translate)
* **General AI**: Aims to perform any intellectual task a human can do (still theoretical)
* **Super AI**: Beyond human intelligence (hypothetical future)

### 🎨 What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** is a subset of AI that can create new content:

* Text (ChatGPT)
* Images (DALL·E, Midjourney)
* Code (GitHub Copilot)
* Music (Suno AI, MusicLM)

It works using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** trained on vast datasets of human-created content.

### 🧠 Why it Matters

* Enables automation of creative and cognitive tasks
* Transforms education, business, and development workflows
* Reduces time, increases productivity, and unlocks new possibilities

### 📝 Student Homework

1. **Watch a 5-min video**: “What is AI?” (YouTube)
2. **Use ChatGPT** and ask: “Can you explain AI to a 5-year-old?”
3. **Write 3 things you’d like to automate using AI.**
